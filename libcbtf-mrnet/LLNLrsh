# this is a temporary hack.  mrnet on llnl systems uses
# rsh for XPLAT_RSH.  But rsh does not setup the environment
# properly on the remote nodes by not using the current
# environment.  Further, this script is hard coded
# to dotkit and then name openss.  This assumes that the
# openss dotkit has EVERYTHING needed to run CBTF or
# an OSS configured to run with CBTF.  So this file
# would need to be edited as needed for OSS and CBTF and
# or just CBTF. UGH!!!
#!/bin/tcsh
rsh $1 $2 "source /usr/global/tools/dotkit/init ; use openss >> /dev/null ; $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9"
